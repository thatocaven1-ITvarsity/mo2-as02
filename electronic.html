                            <h3> LENOVO</h3>
    <p> Lenovo is a good computer brand because of their wide selection of laptops on tap. But quality depends on what specific laptop you get, and that goes for any brand: HP, Dell and Asus are all popular brands due to their reliability and price. But every brand has good models and bad ones.</p>
